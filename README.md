# Project

 This is a project I decided to keep, but now I'm adding some new things to it. The main goal is to implement different filters using Python, NumPy, and Cython, then compare their performance.

-Python, NumPy, and Cython filter implementations.
-Performance comparison and timing analysis.
-Some visualizations and output images.

I’ll update things as I go, so it’s kind of a work in progress.
